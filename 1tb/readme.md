# ESP32 MiniSD 1TB exfat example

This example demonstrates how to use a 1TB SD card with the ESP32 MiniSD module and exfat filesystem. It is designed to work with both ESP32-C6 and ESP32-C3 microcontrollers. You will need to install the exfat library for Arduino to use this example and format the SD card as exfat.

This is not limited to 1TB, but it is the largest card I have tested. The code is designed to work with any size SD card, but you may need to adjust the buffer size and other parameters based on your specific use case.

# Guide

 - Compile/flash the firmware using Arduino IDE.
 - Format a 1TB microsd card to exfat.
 - Make changes to code to suit your needs.
